# Introduction
Hey!

Bellow, you can find an all incluive guide my Comment Counter where I outline how to run the program, the testing suite, program flow and assumptions made. As someone who something, I hope to provide a one stop shop for anyone looking to run the program without addiioal informtion
Clear and concise documentation is an invaluavle resource especially during 

# How to run
The program is writen in **Python 3.8.2** so make sure the version is installed and part of your machine's enviroment variable 

To run from the terminal or command prompt, make sure to be **within this file directory** and execute the following command:

>python3 main.py [path to file to scan]

The parts of the command are the following:
1.	`python3` --> the python compiler 
2.	`main.py` --> name of the main python file that will be executed
3.	`tests\providedTests\javaExample.js` --> path to the file that will be scanned
