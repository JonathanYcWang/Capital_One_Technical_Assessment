# Introduction
Hey! 

Below, you can find an all inclusive guide to my Comment Counter where I outline how to run the program, testing, an overview of technical decisions and assumptions made. 

# How to run
The program is writen in **Python 3.8.2** so make sure the version is installed and part of your machine's enviroment variable 

To run from the terminal or command prompt, make sure to be **within this file directory** and execute the following command:

>python3 main.py test_files/[file name to scan]

The parts of the command are the following:
1.	`python3` --> the python compiler 
2.	`main.py` --> name of the main python file that will be executed
3.	`test_files/javaExample.js` --> path to the file that will be scanned 

# Testing

## Running your own tests
